## General info

In this curse i learned the most concepts for OOP and not too much programming just the bases of every language but with commands not too much just the basic things and hope to learn more in the curse java SE and why is used for. In the code files you will find the proyect UBER and its basically an UML tree for representing the project and his problems
I used 4 languages of programming: **PHP, Java, JavaScript and Python** each folder of language has his own class defined by the name and inside of them has their methods and variables.
The super Class is Account, Car and Payment. 
 * User and driver extends inherits from **Account**
 * UberBlack, UberPool, UberVan and UberX inherits from **Car**
 * Cash, Paypal and card extends inherits from **Payment**

|  Command | Function  |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|  System out print | print any information requeried |
|  class | creates class  |
|  constructor | gives an initial state for an object |
|  String/Int | creates variables for text or numbers |
|  private/public | levels of visibility |
|  this. | specifies the variables used within a method |
|  void/return | specifies whether or not the data can be returned |
|  import | import the data from other file |
|  if/else | sentence that can be one or another and deppends of which sentence is correct is the code will run |
